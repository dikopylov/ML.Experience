I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

It is model number #7033D, a 14" interlaced .28dp.  BTW, if you have a
number to contact the company, that would really be helpful to.  Thanks
for replying.  I was beginning to believe that I was never going to get

Hi,

Can anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin Simms?
I wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two
different types of Simms, preferably a magazine review aricle.

By the way, if there is a FAQ for this group which covers the Simms
information, please also direct me to it.

Any help/information would be very much appreciated.

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but
my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:

        1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller
        2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)
        3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)
        4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days 
                (getting happier)
        5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)
        6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days
                        (cooling off, the end is in sight)
        7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad
                (VERY unhappy)

Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
        and have on-site service install it for me.
BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours
with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$
to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole 
thing is going back.  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is
booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.
Oh well, I feel better now...

        You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing
        that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.
        The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it 
        "marketing."  Lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."
        Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on 
        their corporate headquarters.

        This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do 
        the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape 
        is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for 
        the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block 
        size or write buffer size so it's bigger?

        This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the 
        TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration
        file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup
        from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.

        The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive
        won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.

Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I'm in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time.

Hello world,
 
I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching
purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings
of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for
example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the
students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally
logical, for example. Every instruction should show some 'working',
and not just alter register/memory/port contents.
 
Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,
in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrong
in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller-
as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
for simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to help
you roll your own.]
 
Please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more 
appropriate I should be posting this  - I rarely scan these groups.
 
Thanks,
 
Lloyd Wood

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good
cohesive set of SCSI drivers.

I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does,
so with that you can't share the IRQ.

Anonymous,

I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.
I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's
external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,
but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that
faster... 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!

Hi!

I'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5" b: drive becomes a:, while
my 5.25" a: becomes b:. I'm having a few problems, though.

I know that the ribbon cable must be switched, as well as the CMOS settings, 
to reflect this change, and I think that I've done that correctly. However, the
drives do not operate correctly in this configuration. From the C:> prompt, if 
I type a:, the 5.25" drive light comes on; if I type b:, both the light for the
5.25" and 3.5" drives come on.

There are some jumpers on each drive:
5.25"  Label   Original Pos.   Pos. I changed it to
        DS0      ON               OFF
        DS1      OFF              ON
        DS2      ON               ON

I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any
real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is
the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,
but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with 
claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true
if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it
lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one 
of them.

Any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via
email, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.

Thanks in advance,

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
        - IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX
                there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
        - Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
        - Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
                the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
        - Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
                (jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
                and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
        Many thanks,
                        Cat.

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.

My fiance has a pc-junior and wants to upgrade to a full 386.  Does anyone
know if we could use the monitor it came with on a new machine?  I heard
it's MCGA or EGA, but not sure which.  Also, does it use cards, so we can 
use the drive controller, floppy, etc?

Thanks for the help!

Why not?  This is rather disappointing...

Yep.  That's cause the latest(and presumably all future) Adaptec drivers look
for the string "Adaptec" or something to that effect in the cards BIOS.

We had the same problem in our company. We changed the keyboard-bios and
after that, everything went fine. Our dealer told us that some boards of
that series have a defect kbd-bios.

The ??-jumper is used, if the other drive a conner cp3xxx. 

no jumper set: drive is alone
MA: drive is master

OK, I'll try one more time with this one. If ANYONE out there has ANY
information on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers
(and where they are?) for master/slave configurations. I will gladly
accept any info, as I have a 110M'er sitting in my room collecting dust
just waiting for me to install huge applications. :) Thanks in advance.
(And yes, I regulary check the IDE Harddisk Spec that is posted here.)

Please reply via e-mail since this is job related: 

I have a Colorado Jumbo back-up system at one of my places of 
employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool.

Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried? Does it simply need

Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional
printer port.

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
"0" for output, "1" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

'lo all,

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network.  (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all
the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I
already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

  Thanks in advance,

Andy

Fellow netters,

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated.

I think it is an ESDI controller if you need the doco i can help you.

Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS/2 6-pin mini DIN mouse
port?  I'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who
knows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesn't have it in stock.
I have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on
what sketchy information I have about the port (they have connections to
"reserved" pins).

I recently decided to try using emm386.exe for a memory manager and when I
tried to print to my printer in lpt1 from word55 I wouldn't work.  It would
send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer READY light would
go off and stop working.  I disabled emm386.exe and the problem went away.
I would like to continue using emm386.exe if possible.  I would greatly    
appreciate any comments or suggestions!!  please send them to arthur@u.washingt,

>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)

Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use
the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crash.(I forget)

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
16-bit.

The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.

I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel.

Thanks.

A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so
he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would
bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model)
since monitor manufacturing even from "Big Names" still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects.

Except from clock frequency, what are the differences between the
various types of 386 and 486 processors?
The following is a list with what I know (or perhaps only what I
think I know!). Can anybody extend & correct?


80386:  True 32 bit processor.
        (cache?)

80386SX:  Emulates 80386 with a 16 bit bus.

80486:  True 32 bit processor.
        Internal mathematical coprocessor (Correct?)
        Internal cache (Correct? How big?)
        (extended instruction set in any way?)

80486SX:  Probably sorta like 80486...

80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...

Hello

I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers
for windows 3.1. The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible.
Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an

Thanks in advance

I have a DEC NT 486DX33 that has an Adaptec SCSI controller, hard disk

the system I receive an error message that a boot device cannot be
found. Pull the 3COMM card and reboot, everything is fine. I've moved
the controller and 3COMM card to various slots, different positions
(slot before the controller, slot after the controller) with the
same result. DEC hasn't responded to the problem yet. Any help would

In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine. 

However, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, 
CMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be. 

When unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:

Clock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too.

I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
"device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.

Sorry if this has been beaten to death on this forum.

I am looking seriously at buying a 486 DX / 33 from Gateway.
I will probably buy it without a monitor, as I've heard negative
stuff about Gateway monitors.

I've also heard its tough to get through to technical
support.

I'm seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead
based on criteria such as price, warranty service, general
ruggedness of the system, reliability of the machine and of
Gateway too, and so on.

Please advise!!

Thanks in advance!

Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

Hello Buddy,

I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have
DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
        DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
        for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
        utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
        are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
        for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
        decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
        I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
        large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
        works great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" 
        arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
        I am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That
        has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
        effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy

Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

        I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
        I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
        I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
        Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.
Dan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40
MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the
same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either
product.

MINE has a 16450 sodered right on the card.  Why would you need the 16550
anyway?  From what I've heard, when you're multitasking, its FIFO buffer keeps
you from loosing data.  Is this right?

Hey folks.

Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried.
These are the symptoms...

I have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33)
to boot...

    Turn the power off

    Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip

    Turn the power on

    Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error

    Set up the CMOS

    Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)

    Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]

The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible
but the floppy drives are not.

I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot,
I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I
simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.

Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one?
Where?

Thank you for your kind attention.

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU 
cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough 
to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on.  So far so good.

Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?

I have had a Zeos for a couple months.  While the experience was not
painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7
people I personally know) who have ordered Gateways.  (Of course,
several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as
Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent
out...B{) 

I got the 1 MB Viper card.  The first one was defective, but Zeos
replaced it with only minor hassles.  This one works fine.  I haven't
noticed any problems in any of my applications.  I also ordered it
because of all the complaints about the ATI a few months ago.  Guess
you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average
stuff.... 

For my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no
monitor, viper, etc.) the Zeos was slightly cheaper than Gateway,
Austin, etc.  But this can change from month to month.

Too right it does!

The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't
already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)
get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)

Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair
shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
             
The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".

Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  

Just my 2 cent.

Hello,

I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't
find the answer. Anyway...

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &
electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
Maybe the communication protocol is different? 

Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.

Thanks,

Duco

I need info regarding a miniscribe 3.5" half-height drive. There is a
sticker on it with the following,
    MODEL   HDA    PCBA   UNIQUE   TDA
    8425F   09AA   03AB   03AA     -
But the sticker on the biggest chip on the MFM interface has this,
    MODEL   PCBA   TDA
     FXX    03AB

What is the spec of the drive (# of cyl, heads, etc)?
How fast is this drive? Can I use it as a RLL drive? 
I also have a SCSI interface that seems to match all the connectors
for this drive. It has this description,
    MODEL   PCBA   E-P   TDA
     AXX    01A    29A
Can I replace the MFM interface by the SCSI interface and use the drive
as a SCSI drive? What would the drive size be? There is a set of jumpers
on the SCSI interface with "6SEL" besides it. What is the use of it?

Could someone also send me specs for Seagate ST4096 (5" full-height) drive?

: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape"
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
"gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.

LPT ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  Try this: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings.  Try

C>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1

to set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT1 like this:

C>MODE LPT1=COM1

This should work.  Good luck!

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small "feature" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value.
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.

Serial cables:

There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.
There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG.

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it
with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.
The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.

hello,

for 2 months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either
a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system.

various systems diagnostics (e.g., MSD, Norton) tell me
it's there, but anything I hook up to it can't use it

I have two serial ports on the motherboard

if I set my internal FAX/modem for com4 the utility
programs report a COM3

I've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are
correctly (as listed in most manuals) set

am I missing something very basic?

where should I go from here?

any help, even a point in the right direction, would be
most appreciated.

Hello,

        I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  
appreciated.

I'm using a QIC-compatible 250MB streamer, and I really like it.
But now a terrible typo in an archive description drives me mad ervery time.
Is there any software which can rename, or even better, delete such archives?
Any help really appreciated.

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not 
specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he 
has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
print the forms properly.

This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks

HELP!  I am trying to view .JPG files with my 386SX, 20MHz machine
.  I have a STB-POWERGRAPH graphics card with 1024 X 768 by 256 colors,
with 1Meg RAM on it.

I have tried CVIEW097 (with windows-- EXTREMELY SLOW), and DVPEG24.
DVPEG24 doesn't work!  Even if I pick a lot of the "modes" that are
supported by POWERGRAPH (so it says in the manual), it doesn't work
when I try to view a picture... it only buzzes.

Anyone out there that can help me; give me suggestions?

I would really appreciate it!

Thanks!

Maxitor has a utility called IDE_INT in their BBS, anyone tried it? Can
some one tell me what that BBS number is? Or better, can I find the file

        I am considering selling an Atari 1040 and purchasing an IBM compa-
tible.  I need to know what kind of money or trade I can expect to get for
the Atari before I bother.  I am about to start graduate school, and that
means I'm about to be poor!  (There's a price list for used synthesizers on
rec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)

This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:

  * Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 1.0
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

  * 12" Atari monochrome monitor

  * Generic 2400 baud external modem

  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.
      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)
      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)
      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)
      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)
      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)
      Migraph's Easy Draw (an early, pre-Postscript release)
      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)


        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.
I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.

Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.

 Thanks a lot,

I have an Adaptec 1542B and am very happy with it.

Not so! I have both IDE and an Adaptec1542B in the same box and can use both
disks at the same time, eg. IDE to SCSI disk copy.

I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable
to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy
diagonal noise. 
I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board
(double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector
with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT
to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to
be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or
setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers
to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).

How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments.

Randy

you also need to set the correct switch settings on your xt

proper docs for all hardware contained inside it.

I have no docs on the motherboard.

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is?  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chip/connector name.  It says
(c)1991, WPI

Also, this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard, it looks
like this:

                       What is this connector?

Is this a place to plug an extra memory board in?  I've seen thatr mentioned
in some motherboard docs.  Some allow an 8-meg card and 8 meg in simms.  Is
this what it is for?

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack.  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate.  These are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself, and usually a bit more reliable.

I am wanting to upgrade from a 386SX-25, to a 486DX-33, and are looking at a
cheap quote from someone offering me a 486DX-33 motherboard, with no ram in
it.  (I will probably sell my old m-board off somewhere)
Now, I have 4 meg of RAM in my 386, which consists of

4 x 9 module 1024KB simms, running at 70 nanoseconds.
    ^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Would I encounter problems with the pointed out areas, by throwing these from
one computer to the other?

Any comments gratefully (e-mail preferred) appreciated.

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns "NO DIAL TONE" on its
line.

When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
"bleed" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).

I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]

In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:

>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not

>be dedicated to LPT1.

To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.  

And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But
then, they charge $$$$.

I think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code.

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already
have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

James.

Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.

 Thanks a lot,

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

The difference is that the 16550 got bugs while the 16550A can be used
whithout problems even in fast serial communications. Other sources
say that only the 16550AFN from Nat Semi (i.e. not: second sources)
is really OK.

Connecting devices
------------------
 
  Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
        RxD1    to    TxD2
        TxD1    to    RxD2
        DTR1    to    DSR2
        DSR1    to    DTR2
        RTS1    to    CTS2
        CTS1    to    RTS2
  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
        RI, DCD
  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.
  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally
have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
can be used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
        RxD1    to    TxD2
        TxD1    to    RxD2
Additionally, connect (if software needs it):
        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1
        RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2
        DTR1    to    DSR1
        DTR2    to    DSR2
You won't need long wires for these!
  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission
between two PCs (see software section for details).
  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals
and DSR & CTS are outputs!

I want to have some info about Diamond Stealth Pro / 2 MB VRAM:

  - what graphics modes does it support
  - are HI-COLOR modes included to VESA BIOS (for use with DOS programs)
  - any experiences yet (bugs & advantages)
  - how fast is it under Windows and DOS
  - price

Thanks...

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.

Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
        32k        7.34 
        64k        7.30
800x600 256       10.07
        32k        6.38
        64k        6.35
1kx786  256        8.17

Using ET4000 drivers.
640x480 16M        1.78
800x600  16colours 4.01     
1kx786   16        4.22

From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.

A couple other problems with the 486DX/50:

1.)  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with 486DX/50 systems.  Getting an FCC-B (home use) 
certification required additional shielding in the system.

2.)  HEAT...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling 
fans on their 486DX2/66 chips.  I would guess that the 486DX/50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter.  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability.

I have a Standard Computer 486DX2/66mhz EISA Tower with 16MB RAM, a Quantum 240MB Hard Drive, 1.2 and 1.44 MB floppies and a Colorado 250MB tape drive. I also have a Sound Blaster Pro and a 3COM Ethernet card (3C507) installed. The machine is completely stable in non-Turbo mode. In Turbo mode, Windows for Workgroups crashes or won't come up at all. If Windows does come up, I get General Protection Faults and Divide by Zero System Errors. Is there a problem with memory keeping up with the speed of the CPU o



n these machines?

I have tried to reach Standard Computers, but their phones have been disconnected.
Does anyone know what happened to this company?

Les,

        I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low
emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified"
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
        So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

(Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)

I have a Nanao 17" (F560?)  on my IPX. I prefer it to my Sun 16"
trinitron at work with all those vertical jitters and the two
horizontal shadowmask thingies.

I got it from one of the folks advertising in Computer Shopper et al
for $1050 plus about $40 shipping. 

I bought a cable which goes from the Sun's 13W3 connector to the
monitors 4xRGBS for about $50 from a Macintosh mailorder shop (Relax
Technologies).

I'd do it again. Happily.

I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get 
'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is
also steadily getting worse.

I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the
drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly 
flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).

Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.
I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers
would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!

I am running MS-DOS 5 on an AT clone.

Or has it passed already?? E-mail if possible. Thanks.
