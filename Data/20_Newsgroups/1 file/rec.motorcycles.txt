Do you, by any chance ride a Harley? (just a feeling...) How is your 
neck? Calamine lotion is good, I'm told.

I am getting bored with winding up Americans. Its like bombing fish

OK,

    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin
by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,
it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at
first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,
the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 
900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the
rear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)

So, what did I see?

(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering
center today. It is white with light green stripes.)

                      PRESS RELEASE
 TO::  ALL BMW RIDERS
 SUBJECT:: RALLY TIME IS HERE
 FROM:: BMW CLUB OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
 
 BMW 49'ER RALLY, MAY 27-31  (U.S. Memorial Day Weekend)
 San Francisco Bay Area - 20th annual BMW 49'er Rally, sponsored by
 The BMW Club of Northern Califronia,  will be held at the Quincy, 
 California Fairgrounds, from May 27-31, 1993
 
        Included in the $42 pre-registration fee, $47 at gate, are 4 Star
 camping, field events and trophies, two dinners, rally pin, door prizes, 
 Poker Run, vendor displays, Fun Run, English Trials, and live music playing
 throughout the weekend.  Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse
 D'Elegance and more.
 
        This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the 
 event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,
 "The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
 complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our
 two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River
 Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's
 Highway 49."
 
        Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a 
 pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.
        
        The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,
 two miles South of downtown Quincy.
 
        For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug
 Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA
 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195

 ADDITIONAL NOTES:: 
   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.

   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, 
   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. 
   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony.  

   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on 
   registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course
   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +
   needed to win> and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15>.
   and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

Take this one step further ...

Never dilly-dally in that rear 1/4 of either side of a cage - when you pass
make it as POSITIVE as possible and if you can't pass fully, at least make
sure that if you attempt it you can make the driver aware of you by at least
getting into his area of vision.

This also applies to merging into another lane after making a pass - do it
as POSITIVELY as possible ... and what I "try" to do is look in the rear view
and then over my shoulder.  And after I've done that ACCELERATE into the 
lane so that you have a speed cushion should you have missed seeing a 
potential BDI that's trying to do the same thing as you ... or worse (ie:
he may have been behind you, saw you made the pass successfully but YOU aren't
GOING FAST ENOUGH to suite him so he tries to go around you on the right).

Ride with four eyes...

Rich

  Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery
trucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a "Path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in
front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

The messiest time was in San Diego in 69' was on my way
back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in
the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
milk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing
like the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the
engine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people
waiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.

I've ridden one twice. It was designed to be a monster in a straight line,
which it is. It has nothing on an FZR400 in the corners. In fact, it just
didn't handle that well at all in curves. But hey, that's not what it
was designed to do.
My two cents,
Alan

I just mailed this:

I noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR.
The cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.
My questions are:
1. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away?
and
2. If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are?

To the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?

Thanks,
Dean

Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. 

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was
a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They
said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low 
numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked
great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! 
It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  
I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those 
who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  
( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should
be road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about 
the transmission and taking my chances.

Being a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull
info available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number,
but I'll probably be too busy riding ;-).

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
to this approach. It's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
another worthless adversary. So remember to wear at least calf height leather
boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your

One word "HEAVY". It steers heavy, turns require alot of effort. Hard to get

You know, it sounds suspiciously like no fault doesn't even do what it

Bzzzt.  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally,
and recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than-
average rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely
single front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do
you need?

I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't
had a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors
are very good, IMHO.  Someone forgot to tell their designer about
the "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.

I do hope that the "dump dempster" campaign works however.

for anything to be done (though obviously, it ain't over yet)
On the other hand, 
I'm not sure that I want to be in bed with ANY of the wackos running.
Throwing $20.oo down a rathole might be more effective than sending it in
to the club. You wouldn't get anything, but you don't get anything now.

The magazine you say? Ever since the MOA politburo installed Don it has

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying 
the threads.  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole. 
Therefore the stud was *not* in the hole before you touched something 
down on that side of the bike.

Motorcycle Safety Foundation riding course (a must!)    $140

That leaves you between $900 and $1000 (depending on the accuracy
of my numbers) to buy a used bike, get it registered, get it
insured, and get it running properly. I'd say you're cutting
it close. Perhaps if your parents are reasonable, and you indicated
your wish to learn to ride safely, you could get them to pick up
the cost of the MSF course and some of the safety gear. Early
holiday presents or whatever. Those are one-time (well, long-term
anyway) investments, and you could spend your money on the actual
bike, insurance, registration, and maintenance.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: "Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?"

"Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the
article, and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he
got his drinking money from?

I can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is
looks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out
of hand or of shoddy journalism.

If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they
should put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's
perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that
way myself.

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: "We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models 
really mean. 
Example: What means the C, the B and the R in Honda CBR. - Or the V, S, G, L 
and P in Suzuki VS750GLP

I wanna distribute this in our club magazine. I want lists of all types, but 
I already knows about Harley.

Thanks in advance!

  Actually, I beleive "DWI" normally means "Driving While Impaired" rather
than "Intoxicated", at least it does in the states I've lived in...

  One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor - drugs,
not enough sleep, being a total moron :-), all can impair someone etc...  I'm
surprised this got her off the hook...  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana *is* confined
to liquor?

    You must be mistaken. No thread in this group has ever had a point.


Seriously, there are many 'short' bikes out there.  What style bike
and how much money does she have.  My SO is 5'3" and rides her CB1
or my hawk GT with ease.  Most cruisers are low slung.  YSR50's are
real short too.

 Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!

 BACKGROUND
 ----------

 The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions 
 devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad 
 interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, 
 roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,
 motosports enthusiasts.

 The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little
 over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from
 New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada
 Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.

 The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need 
 to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of 
 performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise 
 ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.

 Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to 
 issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be "flame-free".  

 HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION
 ---------------------------------

 You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:


        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day
 (depending on the topic). 

   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the
       list directly.
 
 After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive
 an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner
 so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in
 order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.
 
 Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily
 or digest distribution (as per your initial request).

 HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION
 ----------------------------------

 It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a
 single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out 
 whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the
 frequency of postings this appears to be about every other
 day.

 Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every 
 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:


        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 HOW TO POST TO THE LIST
 -----------------------

 This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:


        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM


 Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may
 not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it
 (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)
 you can include a "metoo" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX
 based mail systems). 

 BOUNCES
 -------

 Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace
 the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with
 bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,
 sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of
 employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive
 bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and
 if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I
 administer this list) contact me through my administration
 hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. 

 OTHER LISTS

Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on my
Softail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy in
both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me!
 I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying
and making the requisite tools!

MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition: easy to install, but
read the wiring diagram carefully!  Setting the static timing was a
piece of cake.  Once installed, I have found easier starting, smoother
idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the
exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)
The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on
the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.

S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrench
to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes like
a dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so
lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even
backfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, no
hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no
need to rejet from the factory settings!

I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers
out there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began to
get worried. But it all went back together again, and runs like a
dream, so I am feeling pretty happy.

Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NH
Noise Gestapo Test!

Given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching
equipment, I really hate to jump into this thread.  I'm going to anyway,
but I really hate it.

Ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
Does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?

Obmoto:  I was flipping through the March (I think) issue of Rider, and I
saw a small pseudo-ad for a book on hand signals appropriate to motorcycling.
It mentioned something about a signal for "Your passenger is on fire."  Any
body know the title and author of this book, and where I could get a copy?
This should not be understood as implying that I have grown sociable enough
to ride with anyone, but the book sounded cute.

gone up slightly since getting the Ninja, but I'm trying very hard to restrain
myself--the bodywork is just too damned expensive (knock, knock).

        At least it's quiet...

Sure.  In fact, you can do a wheelie on a shaft-drive motorcycle
without even moving.  Just don't try countersteering.

Heavy for a beginner bike it is; 415 pounds it isn't, except maybe in
some adman's dream.  With a full tank, it's in the area of 550 lbs,
depending on year etc.

The 1980 and '81 versions had a much better seat, IMO.

My regulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and didn't overcharge the battery.
The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though,
tending to melt their insulation.  I suspect they were underspecified;
it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air.

Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal.
After you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.

I bought a Yamaha XS850 with 8K miles.  Over the last 2 years, I've put 30K
of commute miles onnit.  Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
5K.  Well every 7.5K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never
change!  If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right?  I know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
up, but I didn't think these kind could.

Bottom lines is that I haven't touched my valves for 30K on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...
What's the deal?  Any other Yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals?

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under "Motorcycle Dealers") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.
But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top
triple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice,
but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-)

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,
or to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.
Now I just try to get them off my tail.

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch
into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than
from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,
I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,
(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  

If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps 
(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get
my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  

A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for
me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,
yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a
cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. 

On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last
vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk
waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing
illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).

Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

  When did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? :-)  According to some

I guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike 
turns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front 
wheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about 
90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the 
bike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember 
which way.

Oh yeah, I tried this in the driveway, on the centestand,(as suggested 
somewhere else) but it doesn't seem to work the same.

        I swore off taking passengers over ten years ago, but I recall
 Sturgis, 1981 getting some strange looks because my passenger
 was reading a book.  She was so engrossed that she didn't even
 notice when we hit a roadkill to make the hit-of-the-day
 with the riders behind us.

Can anyone recommend a good place for reasonably priced bike paint jobs, preferably but not essentially in the London area.

Yes, it was specifically the *ability* or understanding of the
technique which was absent.  We have made a lot of progress between
rider education and responsibility over the last ten-twenty years...
but I am still amazed anytime I teach an ERC how many people of many
year riding experience "discover" countersteering for cornering or
swerving.

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal
"street strategy", like SIPDE for example, was the most important
component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of
emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING
confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or
fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver
is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.

Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter
and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT.

It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they
said it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that
out, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,
does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the 
backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, 
hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a
a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.

The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable
enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat
without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the 
volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not 
has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a 
small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 
10" taller seat.

If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers),
I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an
improvement.

I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take
the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn
signals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with
a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

Because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike.
The things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same.  Ergo, if he's
asking advice, I reasoned he doesn't have much practice, period.  If
you say he does, fine.  I still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a
road that's all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not
to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular
road.  He asked for advice, and even though it wasn't what he meant,
I still consider it some of the best I've read.

Hello Folks,

I'm very happy with my "new" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are 
my questions:

1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece 
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it 
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?  

3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 

4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

Thanks,

Don't forget little girls!  My not-quite-2 year old daughter now
excitedly points and says "motorcycle" every time she sees one go
past.  I've done my work.  (Of course, it helps that one of her
books shows Sir Topham Hatt in a chaffeured side car rig...)

See above.  Were you by chance coasting when it stuck?  On a two stroke

In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap
that is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination 
of information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that
I would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member
Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?

                                   April 4, 1993

re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick:
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:

"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with
the word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does
not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the 
process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind the
letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.
   With kind regards, I remain,
                                 Robert Higdon

O.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know who
Cecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he is
a pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions.

Craig Vechorik

I don't have the grips, but have looked into getting them. it's my 
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european 
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (K1100RS, K1100LT, etc).
it's also my understanding that the heater resides _inside_ the bar 
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by 
providing more bar end mass.

I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100+ degree texas summers.

'course, I don't actually have them so you can save your flames.

good point.  the "list" actually started out as an extension of my GS
v. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name.  since inception,
however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been "geared" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.

>for the sake of not forcing the split issue,
>how about changing the charter and renaming
>your list from bmw-gs to just bmw?  would that
>make everybody happy?

when i raised the "to expand or not to expand/that is the question"
question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has
always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing "from:" line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is
appropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD
bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.

at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible.  the list is fairly technical, with "how do i do this?",
"what kind of that should i get?" kinds of questions.  there has yet
to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or "any bmw mfg'd after
1962 is a piece of shit" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the
governed, proscribed.

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
net.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.

so, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone
else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded?

        I've already discussed this in e-mail with Jonathan.  It's the film

Um, you gotta understand these "salesdroids" as you call them.  They look at
it this way: burn lotsa tire; make lotsa money.  I'm sure s/ he knew how
stupid the "HG" was.  Would you seriously stop them from burning off 
a seasons worth of tire??  The SQUIDS probably would buy Metzelers or some
good low profile tire anyhow...

Yep.  Them droids sure a sneaky bastards! ;)

        I had one for one of my old bikes.  Worked fine.  I'm sure, being
rigid and nonflexible, that the "Cyclelok" would yield instantly to the freeze

he mistook you for one of his friends, possibly an off-duty cop.

        Run your bike on the lowest octane that it will run smoothly on. 
Higher octane fuel is not "better" than lower octane gas. Pick up the last 
American Roadracing magazine. There's a short article in there about 
octane and the misconceptions many people make about the subject. Look at
your owners manual. I believe it states 87 is just fine.

Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong 
as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt
found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't
used their brakes at all prior to impact.  

I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in 
a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do
any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be 
wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because
I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even
milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully 
the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking
with the front brake, of course.

Me too. Even after I bought the 3-piece Krauser K2 set.  Now and then, 
DK puts them on sale for 50 bux or so to clear out inventory, but they
never seem to to go away.  They are the Volkswagens of tank bags, I guess.

BTW, the late Paul O' Neill showed me a trick with a pair of pliers that
will extend their life considerably.  When the zipper starts to separate
behind the pull (because of age and wear), squash the pull body with the
pliers just a bit to tighten it back up.  I would have tossed my bag three 
years ago, but this fixed it up and kept it secure and reliable.

Ford had an anemic mid-sized car by that name back in the last decade.
I rented one once.  That car would ruin the name "Zephyr" for any other
use.

My CB750 does it too.  The "Switch Continuity" section of the wiring diagram
looks something like this:

        I'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the
GS550B and, I think, the GT380M) I was able to pop a Cibie' insert directly
into the original housing (held in by those roughly W-shaped springs).  The
inserts used 55/60W halogen bulbs, and were great, although Mr Bill later
indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.

Jim,

I hope you never drive (or ride) when:

you have been drinking 
you have been taking prescription drugs
you didn't get enough sleep the night before
you are upset with your girlfriend
you just didn't feel like your brain was talking to your body
you think you are at laguna seca and want to break the lap record

ANY of the above situations have the potential for harm (read death)
People make mistakesIf you have never endangered someone else by driving a vehicle in an
unsafe manner, then go right ahead and bitch about Mr Infante misuse
of a motor vehicle.  Otherwise, think about your OWN driving responsibilities.

I am sorry about the loss of your friends, but it could just as well
been the idiot who bought a Volvo because he has problems falling asleep at the
wheel.

I actually saw this movie about three months ago, but it wasn't called
EASY WHEELS.  It was something else that escapes me at the moment but
I did rent it from Blockbuster Video and it was a hoot, in the same
class as Plan 9 From Outer Space.

I would prefer a picture with you in it.  Since most motorcycles don't post,
and are rather similar looking (i.e all R100S's are more alike than they are
different), it is the people that are ultimately more interesting.

Interestingly, I've been to Stanley, ID by motorcycle.  Nice little town,

    It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially
on two-strokes.  It's very common to do this on bikes where the
cylinder-mounting through-studs don't prevent the cylinder from being
removed with the engine in the frame.
    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was
easier yet because it does not have through-studs.  Base flange studs,
and separate head bolts, dontchaknow.
    You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc. to keep
clips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc. to support the
cylinder while you're inserting the pins.
    (Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK? If so, what's a Gudgeon?)

Shaft: Bamboozle, beat, beguile, burn (or flame), deceive, hoax,
       hoodwink.

Drive: Campaign, crusade, push.

So, 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile,
efforts where are true to the spirit of this list.

Wheel: revolution, swing

Crusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot
swing, either, therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies.

I have been checking out bikes (hoping for lowish seats) for a few weeks.  A
Honda Twinstar (250cc) fit me well, a Honda Hawk (400cc) did not, the
Kawasaki 250HB/SB/SH? (can't remember) looked like it would fit me well but
the price tag was way too large...

        What you are trying to describe is that transition point where
        the front wheel actually reverses direction; turns backwards.

        How about some citations or is this just impressionistic speculation

 For 30 years I've been laboring under the delusion that chain drives
        were more efficient that shaft drives.  Chain drives are also stronger.
        (Ever seen a successful shaftie dragster?  No.)

        No flames, please!  I've got both kinds of drives.

  There was a guy around here who would do them on an early pre fairing
Wing with a Hannigan. He would get it right up and ride a ways. Pretty
intimidating sight. 

  He was real good. He had to be. I guess you wouldn't get away with
chopping the throttle more than once.

also, if I plan on doing long-time riding are these twin-V cruisers the best bikes to get, if I dont want something massive like the goldwings?

The Honda ST1100 was designed by Honda in Germany, originally for the 
European market, as competition for the BMW 'K' series.  Check it out.

_Cycle World_ puts one out, but I'm sure it's not very objective.  Try talking
with dealers and the people that hang out there, as well as us.  We love to
give advice.

Most of the bigger banks have a blue book which includes motos -- ask for the
one with RVs in it.
