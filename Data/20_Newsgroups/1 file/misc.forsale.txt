I don't want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd known
what I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
"nope" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.
Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead.

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and
so would the people reading it.

Not to mention the thread about selling someone's wife. I am a guy, therefore
not overly bummed by it, but a little common sense would dictate that this

Not true.  Dial 811 and listen to the recording.  If you get it, then your 
phone was recognized by the network.  You wouldn't be able to dial a real

I need some used scanners.  I'm limiting my selection to HP models
with document feeders.  I think this means the ScanJet Plus and the
ScanJet IIc.

so...if you have one of these and want to sell it, please tell me.

--kyler

P.S.  I need only one with a Mac interface; the others are for IBM-PC
compatibles.

         display is calibrated in dB and can display the average energy per 
         band, or the average for the full speactrum(great for checking how 
         loud your system is)

 This is one of the best equilizers around.  It is very quiet, and the display

        Smith Corona Typewriter for sale,

        Model SCM 70 electric.

Great for forms, envelopes, labels, small things, etc. that you just
can't do with your microcomputer.

Built like a tank, but not big nor that heavy.  A classic compact
electric, with padded storage bag.  No scratches, enamel paint chips
or dents.  Cloth ribbon, 2 colours.  Will accept best offer near $70.

(Selling for a friend, so these are her instructions not mine.
RSVP to this account, though.  Make any other offers anyways,
I'll pass them along.  A single sheet-feeder for the Macintosh
Imagewriter II would be acceptable in trade, for example.)

I was wrong! I guess they are closer to $800 new! I will
probably still sell them for the above implied $300 obo.
Email me if you want more specifics. This is a really 
attractive set of books, kind of a Bible encyclopedia set.
Also email me if you know more about these books or post

Hello Everyone,

    I have a Casio TV-470 LCD Color Television for sale.  It
is in mint condition.  Retail is $199 but I'm looking to
get about 1/2 of that for it, tops.  Highest bidder in 
a week gets it, assuming the highest bidder is at least $60.

TV comes with black case and uses 4 AA batteries.  They also
sell AC adaptor.  It has external jack for phones and external
antenna, etc.  The picture is very good and it has electronic
tuning so you don't have to screw with tuning a picture in, etc.
I have the box and all documentation.  This has seen less than
3 hours use as I have all but sworn off TV.

Best Regards
Jack Waters II

I just won an IBM Wheelwriter 6 typewriter in a raffle here on campus. 
Since I have a nice computer, and really need the cash, I'm putting it up

above that plus shipping.

 other interests.

 One last thing, if you know any non-profit organization whom might
 be interested in my equipments, please let me know. Because if no
 one wants to buy them, I might as well donate them and get a tax
 break...

 Thanks.

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)

        Well, Dale, I'd say offhand "Keel-hauling" would work pretty
well...we haven't had a good "keel-hauling" in a long time... (Sorry, it came up in a conversation yesterday and, well, I just love that phrase...)
        Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with
the FAQ for net-etiquitte...sort of poetic justice for all the junk mail
he was trying to generate anyway...

        My friends and I have a buch of books for sale. They are not
        being used due to change of job, loss of interest etc.

        Rather than letting them gather dust, we would like to pass them
        on to others who may use them (of course at a price :-)

        Topics Include:
        - C/C++/Other Programming Languages
        - UNIX/DOS/OS2/Windows/Other Operating System topics (General)
        - X/Motif/OLIT/Xwin
        - Networking and Digital Signal Processing
        - Computer Graphics
        - Microprocessors and Computer Architecture
        - Math
        - Software Engineering/Algorithms/Software Testing
        - Databases
        - Expert Systems

        The list is long and rather than posting it here I will email
        it by request.  I am going to keep the list updated and so will
        respond to all requests (lucky me :-)

        If you are interested drop me a line

I have an old Optonica tuner and integrated amp that I no longer
use.  The integrated amp section does not work right now but should
not cost much to fix.  I believe that it is just a Chip.  I have 
used it as a preamp and it works great!

This is a very nice looking and well built set.  They both are low 
profile but the amp is rather heavy.

The tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.

The amp is rated at 75w/ch.

These peices went for about $850 New.

I would like to get $150.  obo  for the pair. 

If anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, I have had an estimate
done that it should cost less than $50 in parts.

Please email me if you are interested.  I will be moving back home for
the summer and will sell it back there if I do not do so here.

Todd

Hallo all...my girlfriend and I will be travelling across the US this summer,
so we won't be using our tickets to return to Hawaii.  Please buy them.

The tickets are one-way, leaving Peoria, IL on May 17.  It connects to the main
route in Minneapolis/St. Paul, and from there goes on to Honolulu...you'll be
in Honolulu at 2:42 pm, and flying via Northwest airlines.

Any offers will be considered, but please make sure these are serious offers.
Tickets to Hawaii aren't cheap, but we're aiming to make two people very happy
this summer.

I would like to buy a cheap modem for my Mac. Did I mention that I would
prefer it to be cheap?  2400 baud preferred, but when you're looking for
cheap (and I do mean cheap) beggars can't be choosers.  E-mail me.

Oh, I'm in Seattle, so if you were also, that would be a bonus.

Forsale:

Proton P1100 preamplifier
========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150
or best offer.  Has inputs for tape 1, tape 2, CD, phono, video and tuner.
Separate listen and record selectors.  Bass EQ, subharmonic filter and mono
switch.  High quality volume potentiometer.  In excellent condition, with
original boxes and manual.

Sony D-88 portable Diskman
========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's.
You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works
well,
but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned,
etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With
carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best
offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.

Please email me <eric@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu> or telephone at
(617) 278-0068.

*********************Sony B+W Watchman TV*********************

Sony B+W 2.5 inch TV.  It is in excellent condition.  It has not
been used much at all, thus why I am selling it.  It gets great           $60
reception.  It sells new for $100 so I am asking $60.  It is small
enough (3"x6"x2") that you can carry it around anywhere.

Hey,

collection.  I am interested in buying any in good condition.  I am 
particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ] 
transformers into one etc...  I am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending
upon the model, size and original cost etc.  I will also pay airmail postage
and packing.  I am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots,
rocketships, micronauts etc... There is only one catch.  I live in New
Zealand so you have to be willing to post the items there.  I hop that
someone can help me out. 


Cheers

Darren

a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  Some titles I have posted
here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space.

What's so special about this label, that their discs are going for
upwards of $6 more than most retail outlets average prices for CDs?

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs
a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am 
putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS 
magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping
included.

WinSong for Windows:

Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.

It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move
and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.

It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.
Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward
and stop.

It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,
saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.

You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual
is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect.

Almost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered
$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)
