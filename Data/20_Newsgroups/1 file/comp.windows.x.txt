XGOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X
XRULES:
X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:  1993
Xfix:   y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle: title of entry                      (see comments below)
Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:  Date/time of submission in UTC      (see comments below)
Xhost:  Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X       Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:  your name
Xorg:   School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:  postal address
X       use tab indented lines to continue
X       don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:  y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X       * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X         and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X         It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X         incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X         consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X       * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X         to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X         using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X       * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X         it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X         ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X         title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X         sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X       * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X         format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X         something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X         Email message to the judges.
X
X       * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X         'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X       * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X         each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X         should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X       * The entry's remarks should include:
X           - what this program does
X           - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X           - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X           - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X           - information about any ---data--- files
X           - why you think the program is obfuscated
X           - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X           - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X       * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X         portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X         should not be required to exist.
X
X         If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X         section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X         ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X         each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X          'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X          'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X              digit, followed by '.c'
X          your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X              title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X               ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X               obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X    
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments
X
XCopyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.  
XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is 
Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety 
Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing 
Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.
X
XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X       * look at the original source
X       * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X       * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X       * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X       * run it through a C beautifier
X       * examine the algorithm
X       * lint it
X       * compile it
X       * execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X       #define d define
X       #d foo             <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X       int i;
X       j;                 <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X       int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X       int i;
X       char *c;
X       i[c];              <--- use c[i] instead
X       (i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X       * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X       * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X       * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X       * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X       * performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X       * using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X       * are very hardware specific
X       * are very OS or Un*x version specific
X            (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X             code is likely not to be)
X       * dump core or have compiler warnings
X            (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X       * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X       * abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X       * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X       * are longer than they need to be
X       * are similar to previous winners
X       * are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X       * are as concise and small as they need to be
X       * do something at least quasi-interesting
X       * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X       * are portable
X       * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X       * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X       * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X       This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X       attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X       an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X       where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X       contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X       contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X       * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X       * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X               cc prog.c -o special_name               need special binary
X
X           or  rm -f special_src.c                     need special source
X               cp prog.c special_src.c
X               cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X           or  rm -f special_build                     need special build
X               tail +4 build > special_build
X               sh < special_build
X
X       * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X         your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X         should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X       ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges    (not the address for
X       judges@toad.com                                  submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X       Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X       date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"
X       date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X       sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X       sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X       sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X       ---entry--- section
X       all ---author--- sections
X       all ---info--- sections
X       ---build--- section
X       ---program--- section
X       any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X       * reading the ---entry--- section
X       * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X       * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X       * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X       * passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X           shipping over any #include files
X       * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X       * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X           shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X       * linting the source
X       * compiling/building the source
X       * running the program
X       * performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X       * best small one line program
X       * best small program
X       * strangest/most creative source layout
X       * most useful obfuscated program
X       * best game that is obfuscated
X       * most creatively obfuscated program
X       * most deceptive C code
X       * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X       * best abuse of ANSI C
X       * worst abuse of the rules
X       * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X           comp.lang.c           comp.unix.wizards     alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X           comp.sources.d        alt.sources.d         misc.misc
X           comp.sources.misc     comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)
X

Hi, 

I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In
particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some
XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the
pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.

Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server
bug?

Thanks,

Zack T. Smith

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
regularly.

Interesting, I'd like to know why.

But try it again on a single ethernet with 100 X terminals on it,
and I think you'll find it much slower.

Look in xfig.  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple.
Xfig is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in

A new version of TkMan, a hypertext manual page browser,
is now available for anonymous ftp at harbor.ecn.purdue.edu.
If you can't wait until it's moved into a permanent place,
you may obtain it now by

cd /incoming
binary
get tkman-1.3.1.tar.Z

In a few days it will be moved to /pub/tcl/code.

It requires Tcl 6.7 and Tk 3.2, which are also available on harbor.


Among the new features are:

Greetings,


I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals:
PseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).

In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
section about XCteateWindow, something like:
"In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the
parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used 
in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs."

This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the X11R5 guides.

However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch
when I create a window with a non-default visual.
The code looks like this:

------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----------------

Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height)
Display *dpy;
int width, height;
{
  Window win;
  XVisualInfo vinfo;
  XSetWindowAttributes attr;

  fprintf(stderr,"Opening 8 bit window...\n");
  if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  fprintf(stderr,"Using visual: %x\n",vinfo.visual->visualid);
  cmap = XCreateColormap(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           vinfo.visual,
           AllocNone
         );
  XSync(dpy,False);
  XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);   /* ommision of this line gives same result */
  attr.colormap = cmap;
  win = XCreateWindow(
          dpy,
          DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
          10,10,
          width,height,
          CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
          8,                    /* depth */
          InputOutput,          /* class */
          vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
          CWColormap,
          &attr
        );
  return win;
}

--- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT -----

Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.
Anybody who knows why?
If so, please drop me a line.



        Take care,

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create 
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until 
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
        PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | 
        EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
        PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.


If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win 
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear 
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

Hi *,

Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If
yes, will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a
wrong group, please point me to a right one.  Thanks!!

BTW, the list doesn't have to contain the info "How to use
the holes?".  Instead, I need the info of how to detect
the holes, how to seal the holes, and how to monitor the 
activities if possible.

Any info is welcomed.  Thanks!!

I've been told I'm setting the right resource, yet it continues not to

Yes, and you don't want to change this value if you're running Image type

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.

I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system.  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this:

(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,
and not multiple X displays.   Given this:

        - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
        as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's
        nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
        screens?

        - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
        screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
        What are they; who sells them...

        - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a
        window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?

        - Is there any way for the application to transparently see
        multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
        only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?

        - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
        system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
        screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
        multiple screens instead)?  
        I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely
        on providing config files which will specify for each
        configuration the screen placement of each window in the
        application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
        are more than welcome.

No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you
get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering
user actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available.

Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs?

Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :)

Summary                                  
-------
xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped.

What's new?
-----------
I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

Where can I get it?

Hello world,

I want to write my Xt-application code like this:

{
    do_some_work();
    /* now I need some user input */
    XmCreateDialog();
    wait_for_user_input(input);
    if (input == "OK") {
       more_work();
    } else {
       other_work();
    }
}

So "more_work() and other_work()" are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question.

How can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application?

Thanks very much in advance.

Greetings, Huub.

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

I want to do the equivalent of an "xwininfo -name" via a call or set of calls
in Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id.
It's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.
I've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the
FAQ and couldn't find it.

Email to one of the following addresses and I'll post a response if it
seems reasonable to do so.

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is
run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
"regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping
as it should.  To turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.

Do you have the X source code?  Simply look in mit/clients/xwininfo/xwininfo.c and you
will find out exactly how to do it.  :-)

Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its
come up before...

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:
    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)
    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.
        and when all else fails, 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors 
    already allocated in the colormap.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way
though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and 
no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens 
of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?

Any help appreciated,

Does anyone know where these missing functions are located? If you do can you
help me with it?

I posted before to one of the other Unix groups, I tried their suggestions but
always get this error.

If you have to know: I am using Unix system V. The machines here are 486's. The
terminals I want to use are separate and just called X-terminals and they seem
dedicated to that. I'm not sure as to what they really are, since it is one of
my first times out with this X-windows gidget! That is, first time programming
for it, so to speak. I use them alot just for the graphics things.

If you can help, mail me soon.

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
        Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

        typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

        (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
        Many thanks in advance for any help.

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.
You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets
support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that
functionality.

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) 
start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:
Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 
assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and 
Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).
The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company 
for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  
The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering 
(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing 
Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly).
 
In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 
30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework 
assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?

BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). 

Cheers,
  Michael

try this after XCreateWindow:
-----------------------------

#include <X11/Xutil.h>

Display display;
Window window;

{
  XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();
  xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;      /* or = PPosition | PSize */
  xsizehints->x = 42;
  xsizehints->y = 42;
  xsizehints->width = 100;
  xsizehints->height = 100;
  XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);
  XFree (xsizehints);
}

These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above.

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events
--------------------------------------------

To produce regression tests or automatic demo's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user. It should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
an to store them in a file.
This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given 
to the server's queue as if a user is working.


1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
   mouse and keyboard events (where)?

2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given
   server.
   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given
   to a certain client and how ?
   
3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?
   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?


Thanks in advance

Ron.

I "think" you should try linking to /usr/lib/libXmu.a instead of 
-lXmu. At least that solved the problem for me!

        There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

        Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

        I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server

Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage

No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:
"Ctrl Any<Key>q".

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If
you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations.

>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?

If you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.

>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you

I can't think of a reason why not.

>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).

For example,

  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade
                                          -- filePulldown - openPushbutton
                                                          - exitPushbutton

  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O
  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O
  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q
  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q

  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\
    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\
    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.

I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I
described above should work.

I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have
other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.

In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude
picture:

 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================
 |
 |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+
 |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +
 |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +
 |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |
 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================

Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,
with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really
need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.

The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it
is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and
time-consuming.

Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }
functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click
of a button, you can change this:

    +---------+
    + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

to this:

                   +---------+
                   + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

 ===============

Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next "official" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,
and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this
enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)

In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,
look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;
but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:

        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+
        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +
        +-------------------------------------+
        +   this is the body of the window,   +
        +   window A, which is on top.        +
        +-------------------------------------+

 ===================

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my
X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:

#ifdef SHAPE
        case F_SQUEEZELEFT:
        {       static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };
                if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))
                  return TRUE;

        .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and
        squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...
#endif

( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h
  and add
    { "f.squeezeleft", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },
     ... and so forth ...
to parse.c

In order to use these functions, add something like the
following to your .twmrc file:

Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter

 =================

About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I
*think* it didn't get out.

Since then, "blast" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,
Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by
chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a
twm-style window manager, I think.

Hi,
I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0:


        cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c(47) : error C2065: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined
*** Error code 1

Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform, this problem didn't resolve.

So I have some questions related to this matter:

  1. Does _XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 2.0? ( Does _XtConstraintBit use
      in X11R3 & X11R4? And What release does SCO ODT 2.0 use, X11R3 or X11R4?)
  2. If not, Does someone know how to work around?

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

  QUESTION:
  What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal
configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system 
to the TCP/IP access control list?   

  BACKGROUND:
  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and 
2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  
  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the
same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP
Access Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  
  I've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong
or the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  
  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the 
NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with
the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.
  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

   Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
   and the window at a position below it.

   This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
   configuration and restore is later.

   Currently, my solution is:

           XCreateWindow(...);
           XSetWMProperties(..);
           XMapWindow(...);
           XFlush(...);
           XMoveWindow(...);


   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
   if I'm overlooking something obvious.

   Richard.


I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

While I cannot answer questions about running XDM over a DECnet, I can
say that the following defines must be added to the site.def before
building R5 before any X clients will work over a DECnet.

From site.def

#define ConnectionFlags -DTCPCONN -DUNIXCONN -DDNETCONN
#define ExtraLibraries -ldnet

Hoping this helps,

George

We have a program written with X11R5 and Motif 1.2.1.  It runs fine on the Sun
X11R5 server and MacX.  When that program is run under the Sparc 2 and the
OW server, the program crashed itself along with the server.  It crashed before
the first window had showed up.

I got the following error from X.
XIO:  fatal IO error 32 (Broken pipe) on X server "perot:0.0"
      after 62 requests (59 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
      The connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or KillClient.

I have run the program with xmon and below is the last twenty lines or so from
xmon before both the program and server crashed.

*Reminder*   Plan now for the Andrew Conference.
*Date* The dates are as noted below.  (We have not changed them.)
*Submission extension*   We are still accepting papers.

*Tutorial topic*  
        _Converting Andrew source code to C++_

This tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from C
(extended with classC) to C++.  Conversion of the source code requires
only a couple of steps:
        run the converter
        fill in missing type information
Describing this will not take long.  The remainder of the day will be
spent learning how to write objects in C++ and practicing.

------------------------------

1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting
June 24-25, 1993
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA

The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A
tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the
25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the
two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,
though only Consortium members will be able to vote.

This year's theme is 

        Application Construction by Non-Programmers

Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer
construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent
UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will
consider questions such as
        What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?
        Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?
        Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to
create new widgets?
        Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?

Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate
on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including

        applications
        experience with users
        new objects
        reviews of and proposals for revision of 
                internal Andrew protocols

We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would
like to do a demonstration.  

Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.
Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.

Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

Concurrent has a product called RealTimeX (tm) that is a set of real-time
extensions to the X Window System.  RealTimeX is currently supported on
the Concurrent Series 7000 and Series 8000 with the GA5000 graphics
accelerator.  If you need/want more info, let me know.

For image display, about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit
for interactive operations. For just bringing up an image for viewing less
than 1 second seems to be a good number. Of course the measure of response
time should be based on the applications you are planning to run.

X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as
screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1.

Questions:
1)  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 and/or
CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the
CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus?

2)  The CG6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'.
What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install
the SunOS driver / X to be compatable.

-----------------------
I would appreciate any information on this. 
I am posting this on the behalf of Dr. John Charlton (who does not have net

it at this address and I will forward it. 

Thank you for your help!

We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card.

The cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual.
The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to
the 24-bit visual. We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no
success.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome. 

There are two possible solutions:
        If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server, could they forward them to us?

        Otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows?

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

running continuously on my machine for 3-4 days,
the following message appears  when trying to open
a new window, or to run any program that needs to open windows.

The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children 
of a single TopLevel shell:

+-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+
| AppShell  |---| TopLevelShell |---| TransientShell |
+-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+
                                  |
                                  | +----------------+
                                  |-| TransientShell |
                                  | +----------------+
                                  |

While a Transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the 
sensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the 
Transient shell window.  When the Transient shell is popped-down, the 
button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 
(i.e., solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the 
text to revert to the correct visual state.

When tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events 
seen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows.

If anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail.
  Thanks!

REPOST:

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about
this problem........

- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.
  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting
  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,
  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in
ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window
is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 
At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.

If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after
wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the
same.)

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information
in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string; it used
the character count instead of the byte count... a significan "Oops". 
The problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic
patch from HP support services.

Hello!

We want to configure our X11R5 sytem (i486 33Mhz running BSD-like UNIX)
comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then
connect to them. But the only connection works is localhost!
An 'X -indirect <machine>' works very well!
The configuration:

                - starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified
                   in Xservers
                - starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost

             ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in
                  Xacces bye
                        '*      CHOOSER <machine1> <machine2> ... BROADCAST     
                - the number of users on this machines and the load is 
                    displayed correct

                - selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server
                   starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu
                   appears again.

I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5

Please help
                        Lars

I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like
to have the R5 server recognize the second card.


I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the
server, the second device was ignored.  

How do I setup the second card?


Note:  If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds
the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card, and start a second window manager.  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already...


email is preferred... post if you must...

Thanks in advance....

Hello, I am writing a program which forks of a number of child processes
and each of the children printing things on the screen (quite messy in
one window)... 

The "xterm  -Sxxd"  option seems to be the solution to opening up
slave windows only to display output and I use the following code to
open up a pty (taken from Stevens)...and manage to open up an x-term
successfully.... 

The problem however is how do I write into this x-term ? Please help!


static char pty_name[12];
int pty_master( void );

int pty_master( void )
{
  int i,fd;
  char* ptr;
  struct stat statbuff;
  static char ptychar[] = "pqrs";
  static char hexdigit[] = "0123456789abcdef";
  
  for( ptr = ptychar; *ptr!=0; ptr++ ) {
    strcpy( pty_name, "/dev/ttyXY" );
    pty_name[8] = *ptr;
    pty_name[9] = '0';
    
    if( stat( pty_name, &statbuff) < 0 )
      break;

    for( i=0; i < 16; i++ ) {
      pty_name[9] = hexdigit[i];
      if( (fd = open( pty_name, O_RDWR )) >= 0 )
        return( fd );
    }
  }
  return(-1);
}

I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager. One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager, either (1) run 
motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network
traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook
from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).

This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager
(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other).

Well the question is:

  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I
  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager.

---
Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the
large volumes in window.X)

Thanks.

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be
circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're
not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being
a lawyer, I can't be positive.

Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing
else.

        I am looking for info on products that can take
Windows source on a Unix box (such as Sparc), and produce a
Motif executable.  Another requirement is that MFC 2.0 should
be supported.  I already know of:

        Wind/U  by Bristol Technologies
        Hunter SDK
        MainWin by MainSoft

        Are there any others?

        I will post a summary if it's wanted.

Hi, friends,

Our SPARC workstation is now equippied with a GT-accelerator. we want to use
it to display stereo images. The accelerator has double buffers. How can we
access the buffers and switch between them ? With which functions can we do 
that ? with functions from XGL, Phigs, Xlib or Xlib-extension ?

Your help will be highly appreciated.

Get ghostscript and ghostview.  Ghostview is a postscript previewer
that uses ghostscript.

From the ghostview README:



    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.

Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.

Brief list of features:
  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring
    Conventions.
  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.
  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or
    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our
    European friends.
  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.
  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,
    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).
  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale 
    or color on a Color monitor.)
  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that
    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)
  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution
    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).

    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people
    are encouraged to use in other programs.

    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:
        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z
        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z


From the ghostscript README:

*****************************************************
* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *
*****************************************************

********
******** An overview of Ghostscript ********
********

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very
closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and

        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the Ghostscript language.

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.
Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families:

        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible
          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;

        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,
          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,
          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;
          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX
          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;
          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;

        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;

        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler
          version 3.1 or later is required).


(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)

Check out a program called PC-Xview. I've used it before, and from
what I can tell, it's exactly what you're looking for. Last I checked,
you should be able to find it for about $160 a copy.

   Here's a listing that I came accross a while ago.  This question seems to 
come up often enough that I figured this would be of interest.  Note that 
the server "X Appeal" for DOS is available in demo form on the internet via 
anonymous ftp.  This is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of 
using your system as an X server.  Enjoy!

This is a monthly guide of X servers that can be used on non-UNIX
networked machines to display X clients running on UNIX machines.  I
use the name UNIX loosely here.  I know others can run X.

The sources for this information come from many places:  the FAQ for
comp.windows.x, blurbs and info packets from the vendors, user manuals
for the products themselves, conversations with sales representatives,
personal experience, comp.windows.x articles, etc.

Please forward any corrections or updates to the above address.

Hi,
I have a lots of problems using XView (libraries Release 3.2) in order to
do the following:
+ I want to create a MODAL Dialog which block the program flow
  (a syncronous dialog, ala Macintosh) , as the Notice Panel
  does, but with Text Item, List Item, and other XView objects.
+ The MODAL Dialog also must allows the Timer to be called (why
  Notice doesn't do that?).
 
The problems are:
- Using the "xv_window_loop" functions most XView objects dont work
  (as the List Item), and the timers aren't called.
 
- With the "notify_dispatch" explicit I have problem because:
  "...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback
  routine..." as say the "XView Programming Manual (Third Edition)"
  on page 486 (uhm... I know this number!!! :->).
  But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine!
 
Help me, please!!!
 
Thanks in advance,
--- Giovanni

        Text only:
        Graphical Software Technology has Xtra Widgets (includes help)

        There are probably others (check out ICS widget data book)

I actually wrote one for the last company I worked for-- however it is
locked in their internal reuse library.  :-(  
It was a good one too! (IMHO and totally unbiased view of things) ;-)

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function "XmuCvtStringToWidget". I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.

MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {
        {
            XtWidgetBaseOffset,
            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),
            sizeof(CoreWidget)
        }
    };

    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,
                            parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );


However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure
this is a FAQ.

Thanks in advance,

Rik.

PS: What are the header files "CoreP.h" and "IntrinsicsP.h" - should I use
    these or "Core.h" and "Intrinsics.h" (OK I know RTFM:-)

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-
tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,
set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough
advertising.

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X10).

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped.

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.

As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 
than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line
of code). I'll put this on export today.

Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library.
For Network discussion...

Color Coordination...

    I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
  one responded at all.

    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly
  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself
  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,
  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .

    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.
  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this
  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.

     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors
             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.
       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the
       standard colors for use in icons.

     * two extra shades of grey
             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)

     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading
       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
  workstation.

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up
to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens
when bold is displayed.  It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.
I wish someone would prove that incorrect.

Hi there,


  Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
to another window but it MUST appear in that window....

I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!

For example, if I get a program executing:

--------------
#!/bin/sh
read something
....
....
echo $something
....
....
--------------

and if I send the key event "<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a"
to that window then I will get:

something=a


Thanks in advance.

Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows
conference.  Perhaps some good will come of it, but the two are so dissimilar
and the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was 
coming to a similar conclusion as Jesse...

        Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion.  First
get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it.
It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the
page, and maintains page counts.  I've written a little C program to
massage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you
can get all the ascii strings in the document.  No guarantees that it
won't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying
degrees of success.  Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want.

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed
API to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...)
Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization
features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there
anybody has done some similar jobs ?

By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or
Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button....

That will be great if someone can share us what you have done.
Thanks in advance.

SCO ODT allows to adapt the X-Server to any non-standard (AT) keyboard 
using the Xkeyboard configuration compiler xsconfig. SCO provides some
configuration files in /usr/lib/X11/xsconfig/*.kbd, e.g. for 
Siemens WX200.

Question:
Is there anywhere a configuration file for the HP46021A keyboard
available ? 
I am especially interested in using the HP specific keys such as 
"InsertLine", "Menu".

Thanks  -Ron.
