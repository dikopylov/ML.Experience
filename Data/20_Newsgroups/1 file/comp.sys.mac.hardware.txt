My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she
complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it
objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some
people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black
vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something
like that going on here?

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it:
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not
taking multiple directories into account.

We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual
video problem. 

Model:  610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards
Monitor:        Apple 16"

When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done,
particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open
windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple
monitor with 256 colors is used. 

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem has
been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how
to fix it.  Please also respond to azelenet@bigmac.mskcc.org.  Thank you
for your help.

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it
at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above
the minimally guaranteed figure.

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

Yes, but if you upgrade the VRAM in a 900 you get 24 bit color.  So
you really don't care.  My point is that out the box the 950 has
more video capability for the same size monitors.  The 900 can
do 24 bit with both 13" and 16", doesn't support 19", and
does 8 bit on 21" monitors.

I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions,
OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk), I choosed Bernoulli drive. I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot. you ran out of storage real fast.

IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk. 150MB per cartridge

Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in
several FAQs but couldn't really find anything.

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want
(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.
I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
the best (performance wise) and most economical way
to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual
hasn't been very helpful with this.

Thanks.

of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser 
used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040
addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.

Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad
sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference? 
Apparently! :)

Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and
the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far
as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up
to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable 
(backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put 
the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just 
freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset 
switch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error 
message of "Co processor not installed". 

I know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone 
have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix 
it? The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot. That 
probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is King Memory (Not 
kingston) from irvine, CA. They say the problem is in my machine. 

Any Ideas? -- Gene Wright.

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good
advice.

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,
and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB
disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some
problems:

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them
installed in the other disk.

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

Thank you!

I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your
message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my
Q700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge
drives.  My solution was to get Silverlining.  None of
the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;
in fact the only loop that worked was the "Macintosh
Software" loop (whatever that means).

I believe you were misinformed.  I checked out one of the P450's at Sears

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"
with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.

I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out),
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of
many of the "16 bit" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
NB-A2100 and NB-A2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:

Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.

My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

I've just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like "1".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,
we stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

        -Fred

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are...
32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers 
& 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches,
4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5
clocks for a floating point multiply.

(interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)

>2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  Figure
about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright, it may be less.

Call Motorola.  I'm not typing it all in.

>I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.

I'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
ends.  New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can
schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort
of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.

I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly
impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get
that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch
target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors.
Big whoop.  Designing a 100MHz board is difficult and really
expensive.  Priced 15ns memory chips lately?

 My apologies!  I goofed.  The "quick discharge" option is part of the
Connectix PowerBook Utilities package (CPU).  I installed it the same
day as PowerStrip, and didn't pay enough attention.  ;)  Anyway, the
option does exist for those of you who buy CPU.

Readers,

I own a Mac IIsi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc).
Can you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the PDS slot
and 2) the hard drive power feed. Secondly, Can you tell me if there
is a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit
for both combined?

Please drop me a line if you know the answers to these questions.

includes a HD floppy drive, 2 different chips (the SWIM chip was mentioned
in another post) and a different floppy drive cable. Get the Apple kit
through your dealer.

Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me
included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and
started to experience these problems.

Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of
potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware
(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power
manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe
(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I
have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears
to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on
startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is
being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any
non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be
reset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" -
Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button
I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if
someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.

Beyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technical
procedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many others
appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there
has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -
and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230
purchasers who have this problem.

Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,
particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)

But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at
200 MHz.

>As far as the 486DX2-66 goes - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .

But the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,
making it "comparable" to a 486DX2-80

I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.

Hi,

The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.

This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my
drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive.

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad
software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)
just a screwey drive?

Thanks,

Chuck

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?

Thanks,

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated
CPU plus the powercache.  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card.
Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is
due out early next year.  With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030
accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get
credit
for the one you have.  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and I'm very satisfied.

I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC
with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called
8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression
from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though
in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they
asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...

All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying "This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware"
even though there was no cartridge in the drive.

EC>It was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board. I bought one at
a close-out place after the Mac Plus and the awesome 20-meg serial hard
drive were introduced. To pacify people who bought the XL and only found
it was discontinued within a year, Apple sent people like I a letter
saying for $1500 and the XL, they would give me a 1-meg Mac Plus with
the HD20.

The Lisa was originally introduced in 1980 or '81, I forget now, and
sold for $9995 with 2 400k floppy drives and 1Mb memory. It didn't do
too well. <grin>

Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa 2/10. It had a built in
10meg HD by this time and was expandable to 2Mb RAM although that's not
what the 2 in 2/10 stood for. It was the second coming of the Lisa. It
also predated the Mac Plus AND the 20Mb serial HD by quite a few months.
For a short while it WAS the power users system.

    You're correct, except that's Quadra 800 not Centris 800.

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I
want to
play a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Disclaimer number 2:
If it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is about
to end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not
allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

The problem is this:
After starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing.

as if I click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes.

please let me know if you know what this is, it sounds like it is coming form the power supply.

Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half
a year and I love it.  
Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's
(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.

I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing
software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The
scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly
accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art
settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I
frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image
in the note.  Hope this helps!

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a 
total of 1 MB.

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications

using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  

Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.

>Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
>be a reasonably price to offer?

Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.

  At work we have a small appletalk network with 3 macs and  couple of printers.
We also have a PC that has some specialized accounting software that we would 
like to operate from any of the macs. We have Soft PC, and I have found that the
software works just fine under it, but I would like to have all of the data
for the program reside at one place (the PC hard disk). So my question for you
is(actually questions)

 1) is there a board for the PC that will allow you to hook into an appletalk
    network?

 2) if #1 is possible, is there any software/hardware combination that will 
    allow me to mount the PC hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so I
    can use Soft PC to run the application?

 3) if #1 or #2 is impossible, is there any other way to accomplish what I am
    after?

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the "o" are pins, and the "L5 CR12 C37" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To
recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor
momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right
after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens
with no provocation whatsoever.

I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was
a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the
problem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was
really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured.)

This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading
Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,
the swap of a circuit board.

I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
experience with this sort of thing.

I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that
failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed
or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key.  After absolutely
no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support.  They tried it out
on their Centris 610 and had the same problem.  They immediately offered
to get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to me
overnight if it worked.  I could send them my keyboard back after I
got the one that worked.  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave.
It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face
before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option.  I really like
this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it.  On the other hand,
Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great!

According to MacWeek of 2-22-93:

The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra
800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris
610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit
digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,
the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,
with 256 gray levels, on the screen.

Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera
is expected to cost between $150 and $250.

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's
Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have
to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.

The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility
called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.

The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support
for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an
FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will
require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.
Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the
Cyclone's.

For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.

Anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is?  I'm 
trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce
and edit broadcast quality video (including bringing the video in via
video spigot/etc.).  So far I have yet to see anything that's even close
to S-VHS in quicktime, but it'd be great to hear that it's possible.

Gee, nice of them to tell us.  Like, how about a Gestalt response bit for

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube.

>Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.

    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office
has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any
problems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
when I'm not actually working on the server itself.)

I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's
"MacTools Backup" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  

Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.

but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.

Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.
I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds.

Parts

        Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of
        speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the
        oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend
        getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.

           I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for
           less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:

                   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)
                   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)
                   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)

           Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.

           There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a
           Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)
           
        Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
           a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins
           from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.

        Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
           must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
           a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which
           tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up 
           something similar or risk frying your CPU.
           
Procedure

1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from
        the back of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
        posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
        lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,
        rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.
        
9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.
        
10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic
        Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The
        motherboard then comes directly out.
        
11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators
        must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.
        
        Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of
        the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure
        your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.
        
        I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is
        NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is
        a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without
        proper care.
        
12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the
        old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the
        socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new
        50 mhz clock.
        
14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.
        
14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.
        
16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
        1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
        place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
        
17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

18) Replace the phillips head screw

19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,
        something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
        handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.
        
        Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and
        replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and
        be astounded. 
        
        You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
        a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up
        might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since
        modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single
        problem.
        
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real
risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
$50 in parts.

I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that,
but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. 

But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!

Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.

Very interesting are the graphics results (Graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.


Hope you will have the same success than I had,

Rainer

I read in MacWeek that some developers are getting NuBUS cards from apple
with pre-release PowerPC chips on them.  Does this mean that when the
chip is released, those of us with old apples will be able to take
advantage of the PowerPC RISC technology just by inserting a card?

I don't know anything about hardware, so can someone tell me how much of
a cludge this would be?

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB 
SIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting 
the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used 
for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and 
exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  
It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - 
this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do 
this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
single-bank composite one.

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor
design that does just that.  It was announced along with the new 
administration's efforts to cut waste and fuel consumption.  I know that
in the buildings where I work, gigawatts are wasted by unused, always-on
machines and monitors.

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a "newer" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Just curious.....

Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United
States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not
actively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use
of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF
when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.

Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the
computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient PCs that "power down" automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These
new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and
New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual
electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA "Energy Star" logo when
you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.

According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2
emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million
automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain.

Please do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it,
then just TURN IT OFF.

    THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:

    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga
monitor with a centris (hence title).  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any
old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a
Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my
1604s).

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.

personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this $5,  9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably
priced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical.")



Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.

                                                                    -A.

I've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is NOT a
result of the 8/24GC board! Try Zapping the PRAM by holding down
"Command-Option-P-R" durring startup! You will have to reset everything to
your previous preferences (The Date & Time remain intact!), but the Video
Board will start remembering it's previous settings!

Hi, there!
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told,
however, that:
1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI-2.
2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability, which I need.
3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.

Any comments?
Thanx.

I don't do much real work on this machine any more, but would like to keep

Double speed performance from a CD drive does not require SCSI-2 interfacing.
The resultant 300 kbps speed is well within the transfer rate of an LC. In
other words, I believe you have been given incorrect information.

I need help identifying this board that I found stuffed away in a corner.

As the title says, all that is printed on it is NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NB-DMA-8.
It fits fine in my Mac IIci and snooper gives the very same name for the
board.  It looks like it has an HP-IB connector on the back of it and
another connector on the top (2 rows by 25 pins).  It also looks like
it has an Intel processor on it (#A82380-16 Intel '86)

On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the P/N 700584-01.

Anybody ever seen or heard of one?  Or better yet, do you know what it does?
We are all clueless here.  Our last option is to hook it up to our HP
workstations and see if any smoke comes out.

Thanks a lot!

Kevin

It's made by (SURPRISE) National Instruments:
6504 Bridge Point Parkway
Austin, TX 78730-5039
(800) 433-3488
anonymouse ftp at: ftp.natinst.com

Their 1991 catalog lists the NB-8G as follows:

fetch and deposit DMA controller (8 channels)
IEEE-488 interface with data rates up to 850 kB/sec, with DMA and
programmed I/O
   transfers
8 16-bit counter timer channels
RTSI bus (that's the connector on the top of the board - it links it with
   other National Instrument boards
List price of $1295

The board isn't in later catalogs: it has been superceeded by the
NB-DMA2800.

Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought
I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).

To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed
from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.
This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some
aluminum foil down to work on.
        1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.
        2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,
                spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.
        3. Remove the flopy drive.
        4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting
                the supply straight up and out.
        5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom
                side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.
        6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and
                right side of the board and sliding the board forward then
                lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the
                board must be removed first)
        7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).
                This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.
        8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins
                by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.
        9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 
                them in.
        10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.
        11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
                the other large chip just to the right of the processor and
                figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a
                simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole
                in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using
                insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat
                sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.

        12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.
            You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will
            void your warentee.

My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have
noticed.  FastBack II backup utility does not work!!!  The strange thing
is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and
not hardware related.

        OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to
a SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Can
anyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?  If there is such
a cable, can I purchase it from MacWharehouse or some computer store?
If I must buy the cable from James Engineering, how much do they run and
how can I get a hold them???  I guess that was more than 'a' question.  :)
Thanks in advance for any replys.

Subject: PSI modem problem II
Lines: 17

The first problem was the sound.  I tried the M0, but then even the logon was
muted.  I don't want that.  Any other suggestions for that hissing?

The second is really strange.  First, I kept mentioning that FC slowed down
all the time and took too long.  Well I just logged on with extensions off and
I didn't have any slowdown.  Also, last time I was online I quit (which
usually disconnects and quits).  It disconnected but it wouldn't quit.  I had
to force quit, and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in
use.  This is really strange.  I thought it might have to do with fax
software.  Or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely
explanation).  So, any suggestions?

  I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!).
Have you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's
and option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several
times to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those
white annoying lines.
  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
black box. It can help to get the ink flowing.
  Good luck!

What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the
following nature:

Reading real video in for playbak in various app's 5-10 Minnutes in length
Basic editing features for said video - rearange sequences, adding grapic
slides from something like power point etc... 

I'm not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp
performance.  It's for educational/promotional things so the video quality
should be decent.

I'm thinking Tempest or cyclone, Big drive,loads o ram, Floptical or 128Mb
optical ?? - however, I'm not to sure of the various cards and software
thats out there.

Please email any responses,

Thanks

Andrew,
        I had the same problem when I bought some additional VRAM. In my case
the problem arose when I set the color depth to 16 bit on a 14" monitor.  The
problem was solved by sending back the SIMMs and getting different ones. 
Someone on a local bbs I use said that the problem is with incompatible VRAM
chips and that Apple has some kind of repair/technical note discussing the
issue.

        If you've had the problem since day 1, I'd take the chips back to
whomever sold them to you and get good ones.

        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree.  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also
didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :(
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides
the missing key for some good groundwork!

Well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are
in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out
of a Top 10 comp sci school.

The trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the
rest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even
if you don't get a TOP salary.  Which I have always been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow this rule: BOOK=SALARY=FOOD&SHELTER
you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry.

What else could a man want?!

I have a few questions that I would like answers to 
(or opinions on) since I'm thinking about buying a LC-III:

Q1) When the PowerPC-based Macs are announced, what will
happen to the 680X0-based Macs?  

Q2) Is System 7 the 'last word' for 680X0-based Macs? 
Will we ever get REAL multi-tasking for the Mac?

Q3) Will there be a way for NuBUS/PDS-equipped Macs to add 
a PowerPC-on-a-board to their systems?

I'd hate to think that I'm going to put my $$ down
on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a
dead-end product line!

Thanks in advance,

Hi.

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine. (I'm not sure but seems
that the check "Allow owner to see entire disk" should be enabled too).

A bad thing: you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off.

Hope that helps.
