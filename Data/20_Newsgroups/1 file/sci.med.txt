A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud
that she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  She says that she hasn't 
had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-().
This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.

The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing
sleep, social life and sanity over this.

Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping
mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?

                                              [J.F.]

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain
is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in
both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other
therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tension-type headache.

The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got
relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in
migraine.

Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of.

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown
off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,
packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*
sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.

No, this is wrong.  The purpose is to preserve the substances in
the tubes longer by creating relativistic speeds and thus
time dilatation.  Of course, by slowing the subjective time of
the test tubes they get less bored, which is probably what you
were thinking of.

The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:
a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster.  

Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an 
embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying
some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition?

        My blood pressure soars, my heart pounds, and I can't get to sleep
for the life of me... feels about like I just drank 8 cups of coffee.

        I avoid it, and beet sugar, flavor enhancers, beet powder, and
whatever other names it may go under. Basicaly I read the ingredients, and
if I don't know what they all are, I don't buy the product.

        MSG sensitivity is definately *real*.

Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors

Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically
tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle
berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in
such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, 
Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids 
(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste
sour as well.

Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a
diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such
substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.

A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.
We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted
extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We 
awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]

Believe what you will.

The mass of anectdotal evidence, combined with the lack of
a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving
the hypothesis, makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the
most likely explanation for events.

A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post
the following information.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting
to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would
just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  
It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the
size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two
more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's
described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual
cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been
extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake
up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day
it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5
very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that
knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.

She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason
for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected
thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything
came back normal.  

She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any
ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should
see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?

** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently
taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't
recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, 
coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall
out.

Thanks in advance for any help!

I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
from the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
chemicals than other people.  I don't remember any connection being made
with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.

I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week, as a result of a genetic
predisposition to weak capillary walls (Osler-Weber-Rendu). Fortunately,
each nosebleed is of short duration.

Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? My younger brothers
each tried a skin transplant (thigh to nose lining), but their nosebleeds
soon returned. I've seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is
supposed to help, and I'd like to hear of experiences with it, or other
techniques.

If you mean "reactive" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,
hence there is no disease, hence the dietary recommendations are the
same as for anyone else.  If a patient complains of dizziness,
faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.

        A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by:

        1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,
        knees, and hips.
        2. generalized muscle pains
        3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
        4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
        5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She
        isn't diabetic--they checked.
        6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone
           poles do not appear to be straight)
        7. loss of peripheral vision.
        
        Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At
times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg
the symptoms become acute again.

        She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.  Kathy Turner

This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days, and much of the
medical literature is devoted to this.  The most heavily funded studies
these days are for outcome research, and physicians (and others!) are
constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given
situation.  QA activities are a routine part of every hospital's
administrative function and are required by accreditation agencies.  There
are even entire publications devoted to QA issues.

To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So
there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a
given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely
and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums
of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other
hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which
eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies
contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call
THIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both
these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  

Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor
appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is 
ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  


My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make
extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using
methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this
is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach
their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.

Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before
the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is
famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later 
mathematicians did prove them, of course.)  

I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not
so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a 
matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of 
incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to 
objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an
essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step 
of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward 
that goal then one is not doing science.)

When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and
seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also
worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further
investigation.  

In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: 
> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that
> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  

Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable
amount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I
suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately 
specific question to try and answer.  

The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science 
currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  
I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use 
of "reason and observation."

One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether
in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced
practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  

Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with
the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there 
is any existing research related to this question.

     Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of
my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind
of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
it normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the
body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells
apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she
successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active
9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.
     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including
the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know
whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
pregnancies.
     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?
Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)

        In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may
even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels.

No, there is something called the "Delany Amendment" which makes carcinogenic
food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the
1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased
detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.

This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very
weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are
banned.

This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a
time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,
and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.
This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.

If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone
would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates
that enforcement is still in effect.

An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file'".
This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This
is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural
form, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption
was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats.

I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at 0 degrees Kelvin
will have its own "energy signature" -- the interesting questions are
what kind of energy, and what it signifies.

I'd check places like Edmund Scientific (are they still in business?) --
or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere

Some expansion on Kirlian photography:

From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide
To Natural Therapies_, ISBN 0-14-008561-0, New York: Viking Penguin, 1986,
p211, p188.  A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32
alternative health therapies.]

  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the
  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'
  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object
  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its
  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns.

  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up
  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at
  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.

  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's
  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and
  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.

  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing
  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself.

  [...]

  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer
  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...


From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a
consumer's guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,
vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for
evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples
of hokum.]

  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of
  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for
  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.
  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings
  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The
  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,
  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous
  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown.

No, no, we aren't talking about receptors for the brain's sensory

There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the
phenomenon.  I can't recall the details, but I believe it had to do with
the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance.  The "aura" was caused by direct
exposure of the film from variations in field strength.

Tenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain, an enzyme.
"Meat tenderizer" packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings, but
MSG doesn't act as a tenderizer.

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in 
tomatoes?

Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer.

People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?
How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?

  Another folk remedy receives the blessing of medical study.           
Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    
reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.
  For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical    
Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from 
chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate
8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second 
6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    
women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection 
were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   
  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  
It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   
researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    
brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         
thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  
in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         
protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  
try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     
acidophilus in its contents.

  This disease is usually caused by Candida albicans, a fungus that we  
all carry at one time or another. In some circumstances, though, the    
organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    
intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the 
disease is commonly called thrush.                                      
  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     
pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   
Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      
inflammation.                                                           
  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    
tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.
There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals
leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     
their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic  
antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.

Naomi, your best bet is to look in the Yellow Pages and find a listing

Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain
medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,
to have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the 
patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe
an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the
patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the
problem. Either way, the end results are the same.

Listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  Noring's
anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have "candida" from reading a quack book.

So?

I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently
published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome
patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may
have a psychological trigger or basis.  What I heard about this study was that
in one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs
of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard),
while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including
testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.

If this is true, it is truly fascinating.

But, I'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study
really showed, and where the study is published.  Any help out there?

Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the
literature and located two articles that implicated corn (contains
tryptophan) and seizures. The idea is that corn in the diet might
potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it.
Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested.

Extremely rare in humans.  Usually so much else is involved you'd

 I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know,
National Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian
photography.  They had some neat pictures, too.  A friend of mine's mother had
a book on Kirlian photography, only it's photographs took a radiologist to 
interpret.  They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous,
probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it.  Mind you, this
was 10 years ago, at least.  (And boy, does that say something about my age)

Well, I think msg is made from a kind of plant call "tapioca" and not those
staff you mentiond above.

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday, July 6.

12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology.

12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry.

3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain.

3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field.

3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses.

You probably mean "RoHypnol", a member of the benzodiazepine family,
chemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is
probably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one
pill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax,
serax, librium and other benzodiazepines.

I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. 
Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women 
poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  

Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians 
who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go 
from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and 
then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling 
quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon
but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a 
quack.  

I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten 
years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were 
raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their 
farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to 
entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is 
about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition 
either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I 
know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at 
least a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really 
too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the 
medical profession.

In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after 
antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not 
have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is 
needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small 
and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.
Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling 
Elaine's doctor a quack.

Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly 
called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.
Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it 
requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  

Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of 
normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing
factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral 
course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain 
much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in 
it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely 
survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In 
diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little 
buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but 
some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on 
the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it.
If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondiscript.  


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless 
they broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory 
response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  

While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are 
available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of 
the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.

But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by 
the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to 
return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of 
the problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or 
poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective 
therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving 
organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not 
grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is 
the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum 
antibiotics).  

In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and 
humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  

If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology 
occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.

Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria 
tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline 
during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. 
Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal 
problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of 
Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of 
the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina 
problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year 
until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting 
scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had 
the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some 
digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she 
used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex 
returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a non-existent syndrome.

The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria 
which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  
If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through 
aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.
But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and 
some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent 
disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).
 
Some of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark 
Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.

If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, 
fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin 
A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see 
a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

Melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "Dorsal slit" that is
really the first step of the usual circumcision.  It is simpler and
quicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the
anesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as
good.  See your friendly urologist for more details.

GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian
without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).
Oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,
better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)

Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,
just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general
population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among
physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -
any help here a.p.p.er's?)

One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious
choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to
control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are
also extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to
lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,
to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-
minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,
when the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this
personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've
known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them
with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).

Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)

Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.

You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being
the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent.

In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune
stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses
were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.
I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the
details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this
diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal
therapy below).


The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being
considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween
infection.

>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what

>Elaine's doctor a quack.

I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after
my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then
dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received
zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular
specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,
he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)
supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.
Call me carrot face.  :^)

Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to
all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for
example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had
good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.


>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In 

Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my
sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered
normal).

BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't
remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's
which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)
aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion.


>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
>the candida or not isn't certain.

My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.
Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow
part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,
one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a 
Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.

BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",
has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic
anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over
90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it
doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection
is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that
nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.

This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by
direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,
lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who
has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.


>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
>nondescript.  

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture
the yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.

It's a real Catch-22.

Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that
no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not
up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which
should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,
you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get
funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other
doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get
nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable
hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - 
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus
species can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing
in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but
you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has
been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in
e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-
term treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It's like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away.

The $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the
classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal.

As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.
For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live
with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and
fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.
Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to "live with
it".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The
anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those
having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.
Be sure to get the revised edition.)


>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
>patients is a non-existent syndrome.

Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his
visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said "you'll just have
to live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and
non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a
systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-
"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,
"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient.

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical
yeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people
have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -
you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does
something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which
we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach
(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having
exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I
went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,
and as a result I have found significant relief.

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)
therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:
"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority
to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I
can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State
Board."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic
reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the
patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of
which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all
(true quackery).

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.

Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune
system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual
desensitization.  I now kind of like being called "anal retentive" - it has
a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might
even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...

Thanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have
researched this area and are lurking in the background will post their
thoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.

Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something
as being a "mistake"? It seems to me, that proponents of pseudo-sciences
might have their own ideas of what constitutes a "mistake" and which
discoveries of such previous mistakes they accept.

Maybe, maybe not.  A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but
perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or
15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
whole 'nuther matter.  A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology
is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
the former.

If the radiologist is also trained in OB/GYN, why not?

There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,
I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level
of endemic infection in that region. Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease.

Please get it right, Jon.
(This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes,
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the once-pristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)

The dominant correlation is NT <-> Phlegmatic (and _not_ NT <-> Choleric).
One of the semantic roots of "choleric" is the idea of "hot" (emotional)
and one of the semantic roots of "phlegmatic" is "cold" (unemotional).

Perhaps in serious pediatics and "my little boy's got a runny
nose, doctor" general practice, but, please God, not in neurology,
opthamology, urology, etc. etc.  And NF-psychiatry should seperate
from NT-(i.e. real) psychiatry and be given a new name .. something 
like "channeling"  :-).

But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal
evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will
NEVER lead anywhere.  I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where
anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by
follow-on rigorous clinical trials.

Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circle
the wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless
(maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence
to support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  But
evidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out and
determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better
understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating
illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not
worthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is
being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
other people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of
people.

I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in 
family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Jory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with 
the American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste
good" (as I recall).

The cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods
suddenly became "yech".

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's
nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these.

There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help.

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.
Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.

Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSP's) and DNA.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!  

Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.  

Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance.  Don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information
before you do!

No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion
flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.
They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is
that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as
hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman
constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out
of kilter, and you get sick and die.

I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real
life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this
book, I would imagine you would have to:

1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy
   water.

2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other
   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.

During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and
eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the
poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the
water the victim ingested was heavy.

You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both
alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly
begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the
heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real
story here.

Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was
no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.

The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids
would literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and
heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by
about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe
the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that
the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test
involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

Paul.

"There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries"

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA.
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money.
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
OK.
     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.
     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering.
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them.
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
Karl Marx lives.
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician?
     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor?
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over?"
     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care.
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.
     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs.
     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  
Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for 
our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's?
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch 
cabbages.
     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
they might have been more honest if they had said:
     "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, 
you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
     "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
     "In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day.
     "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-
greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
there is another solution: Don't use them.
     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those 
spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit.
     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest 
pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
there, and pop in a couple of valves.
     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  
And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots.
     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn?

I've gotten migraines after exercise, though for me it seems to be related
to exercising without having eaten recently.

              FDA Approves Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive
                      P92-31 Food and Drug Administration
              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan - (301) 443-3285


The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera, 
an injectable contraceptive drug. 

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone 
progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. 
The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is 
released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent 
effective.

"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent 
pregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable, 
given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to 
missing a daily dose."

Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and 
clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive 
protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the 
injections.

As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and 
risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional 
before making a decision to use it.

Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive 
studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies 
in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo 
Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.

The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In 
addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, 
dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have 
acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood 
clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.

The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the 
drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to 
osteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this 
potential effect.

Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for 
contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., 
which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive 
Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. 
At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause 
breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, 
including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.

       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses
                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration
                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177

The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new 
rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-
threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. 

"These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious 
illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would 
otherwise be possible," said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. "The effort 
to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and 
indeed a hallmark of this administration." 

These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the 
drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such 
endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in 
themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified 
scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. 

Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval 
earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or 
prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. 

The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and 
effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. 
The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct 
postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate 
endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. 

One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a 
model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the 
cause of AIDS. 

Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that 
a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used 
safely only under a restricted distribution plan. 

"The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process 
without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA 
commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished 
faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and 
effectiveness standards required by law."

The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the 
postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit, if there is 
new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective, or 
if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal 
of the drug or biologic.

               Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing
                       Blindness due to Retinal Disease

                   National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation

        Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests

     Baltimore, MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco 
and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that 
certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can 
prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The 
degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of 
visual impairment 
     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose 
their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug 
treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million 
Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 
100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease 
that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo 
surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. 
     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) 
Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye 
Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas 
Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge 
Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an 
exclusive license for this research from UCSF.
     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to 
assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring 
substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. 
Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their 
photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light 
exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic 
Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing 
unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and 
Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. 
     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of 
Clinical Research, said, "BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that 
have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-
related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, 
and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may

result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF 
could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached 
surgically." 
     "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the 
retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases 
to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope 
that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression 
and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., 
Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. 
     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in 
conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for 
peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, 
motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By 
itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). 
     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a 
leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve 
injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and 
Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease

     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary 
heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have 
traditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to 
investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have 
serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing 
countries. 
     "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and 
have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the 
importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body 
weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing 
countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr. 
William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid 
metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. 
     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the 
food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while 
simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  
These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra 
Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have 
coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary 
heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is 
virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name 
Tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on 
"kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more 
while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.
     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, 
and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, 
together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras 
also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains 
approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 
percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator 
in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while 
low in cholesterol and fat.
     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values 
are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated 
cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20

disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the 
Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although 
able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-
cholesterol. 
     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria 
Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school 
building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food 
was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the 
investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food 
stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, 
and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for 
cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements 
included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  
Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were 
fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet. 
     "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 
percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that 
many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in 
fiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in 
the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian 
Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that 
incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in 
the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol 
level, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet 
averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's "affluent" diet used in the study 
ranks a CSI of 149. 
     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of 
establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before 
exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating 
dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or 
plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat 
and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You 
must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put 
into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not 
discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease 
because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on 
a plateau," Dr. Connor says. 
     After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma 
cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL 
fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, 
and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride 
levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in 
weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, 
yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 
days. 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21
Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993

     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized 
nations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount 
of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic 
study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary 
cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  
In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total 
calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects 
the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary 
cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased 
quite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.
     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of 
coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of 
fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because 
of their usual high fat intake. 
     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 
percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI 
around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in 
meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent 
suggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original 
Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of 
fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of 
meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to 
olive oil is not going to help the situation." 
     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the 
emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies 
undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart 
disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different 
diet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the 
entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, 
which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the 
developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can 
concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public 
health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for 
unnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.
     "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move 
their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a 
very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary 
heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years 
ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.

 Include small amounts of hot, spicy foods with your meals. It's
 not a cure, but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus.
 You may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water 
 (consult your doctor first!), which is available OTC in Canada.
 If you have a sedentary lifestyle, exercising sometimes helps.

 I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,
 so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.
 
 Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should
 generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid 
 complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)
 you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other
 major component of the bioflavonoid complex.
 I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it
 showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-
 fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
 hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids 
 to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.
 Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so
 there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole
 bioflavonoid complex instead.

 I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
 they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose 
 bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...
 One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day
 for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.
  
 They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can
 be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are
 made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.

 About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, 
 with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.
 For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.
 
 In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they
 are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine 
 bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
 small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times
 higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark
 extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.
 The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'
  
   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:
 
   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable
   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing 
   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable 

   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing
 
   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!

Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA?  My
uncle has emphesema, and a doctor wants to try it on him.  We are
wondering if:

1.  Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his
condition, or any condition?

2.  What possible side effects are there.  How can they be mimimized?

Please respond via e-mail to    rme1@cornell.edu

hi all, Ive applied for the class of 93 at quite a number of schools (20)
and have gotten 13 rejects, 4 interviews and 3 no responses.
Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters?
According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out
the number of their class in acceptances by mid March. Whats going on... I
am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day.

Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i
kind of looked into Chiropractic and Podiatry but they really dont
interest me. Thanks.

Having the cat around is not a problem, but the pregnant woman should not

Nasopharyngeal cancer is (roughly, don't have references at hand) 20-30
times more prevalent in Chinese than Caucasians, particularly those Chinese
from southern China.  One province (or region) has an extraordinary excess. 
The Chinese and others have done major studies.  Some association with
the Epstein-Barr virus has been noted.

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and
time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances,
both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to
the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the
parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
caregivers, at worst. 

As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this
regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions
you make for your child, it will have far less importance than
many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents
think about only a little. 

This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who
feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a
momentous medical decision.  It is not.

First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,
not humans.

Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an
uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's
terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be
turned into heat.

2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled
amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.
It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than
play around with 2,4-DNP.

But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own
university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year
organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's
a commonly-used reagent).

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came "out of nowhere."  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary.
I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed.  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs.  Alternative (better>) ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden.  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come.   

These ideas are not the stuff of "great" discoveries, of course, but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality.

Yes.  And he was lucky to have such a colorful, vivid image.  I, alas, will
never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought, 
"have him count objects instead of merely count" to mind regarding my 2 
year-old's fledging arithmetic skills.

The latter.  Worms wiggling around in the dirt fascinate my son.

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In
particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which
facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over
$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox
products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
bulkiness.

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.

I saw this a few years ago on "Tomorrow's World" (low-brow BBC
technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of
de-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressure
waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get
electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
break up.  This is completely painless.

Of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through
the urethra.  Ouch!

The use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been
around for a few years.  Depending on the type of machine, and intensity
of the shock waves, it is usually uncomfortable enough to require
something...  The high-power machines cause enough pain to require
general or regional anesthesia.  Afterwards, it feels like someone
slugged you pretty good!

David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline 
search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since 
commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or 
bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.
This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are 
recommended rather than yogurt.

I guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria 
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the 
anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy
denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and 
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain 
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion 
was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the 
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida 
looses it's major food source.

Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is 
normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal 
yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has 
been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in 
the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting 
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their 
patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if 
ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age 
emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the 
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to 
help patients or does it look the other way.

This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous 
therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But 
there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty 
hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only 
well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or 
do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to 
work yet?

My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they 
involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into 
the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other 
is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a 
problem with recurring yeast infections.

Actually, this was a school in England.  This same biology teacher also

I have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow

I think I'm fairly close (by the way it was GREAT!)

1       pint of plain yogurt 
1/2     med. sized cucumber finely shredded
3       cloves of garlic (more or less by taste)
1/4 tsp dill weed

The yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee
filter and allowed to drain at least 2 hours (you can
adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time
up to 24 hours)

The shredded cuc is drained the same way

Mix it all together and let it steep for at least
2 hours (it's better the next day) and enjoy!

This effect disappears if you clean your apparatus after you kirlianed
the whole leaf and before kirlianing the leaf part.

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post.
To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.

as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the
results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)

3 schools i heard nothing from at all.

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me.

I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles
and a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me)

my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR
I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art
history, politics etc 

Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work
for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?
I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety?  

If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety
thereapy hehehehe :)

I made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting
studies like a CT or MRI when I don't think they are indicated.  If the
patient won't accept my explanation of why I think the study would be a
waste of time and money, I suggest a second opinion.

ANNOUNCEMENT:   The "HyperKnowledge" PROJECT for NeXTSTEP

Motivation

We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our  
work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by  
incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often  
claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools  
together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  
much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  
tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  
rather than what it means to have attained it.

What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  
we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  
highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  
specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   
The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  
requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  
user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  
possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  
much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   
By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  
to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  
particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  
results, and combine information from many different sources.

Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  
Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   
While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  
motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  
system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  
data and daily work.


Why NeXTSTEP?

What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  
object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  
highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  
NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  
of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  
available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  
have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  
GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  
mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,  
or more probably because of, OLE).

In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  
such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  
together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  
"Hyper-knowledge" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  
minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  
environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  
best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  
can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  
an "AVS"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?

Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.

 New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at
Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported
 To: National Desk, Health Writer
 Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or
          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research
          Institutes.

   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing 
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research
Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research
will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,
Radiology.
   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led
by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special
software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical
Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton
MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination
time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10
minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing
for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the
patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.
   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including
AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease.
   "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted
with either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding,
"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."
   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker
in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed
with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their
level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was
significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.
   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross
believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15
years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.
   "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce
Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher
and a co-author of the study.
   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,
Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,
R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200
General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,
and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.

May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or

   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:

   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist
Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,
loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.
   How many people does it affect?
   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in
the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking
approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's
debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both
emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the
most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every
year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.
   What are its signs and symptoms?
   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have
been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk
of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50
yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial
AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of
developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness"
caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School
of Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and
suggests the following criteria:

   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
      normal.
   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.
   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.
   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.

   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms
of dementia.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
"Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm
rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature
in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among
them will no doubt jump on that.

Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption
that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the
GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for
maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even
though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his
nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his
equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the
FDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can
charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as
thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.

Unfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of Net.Medical.
Discussion without a credential and without understanding that the
righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced
before dismissing you as a fool.

But maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will
send you some reasonable responses by e-mail.

Oh yes, I did have a point.  A few years ago an MD with a thriving
practice in a very wealthy part of Silicon Valley once recommended that
I take such treatments to clear up a skin condition.  (Not through his
office, I might add.)  Although I'm sure that's not conclusive, it was
sure an unusual prescription!

What is the healthiest way to deal with earwax?  Should one just leave
it in your ear and not mess with it, or should you clean it out
every so often?  Can cleaning it out damage your eardrums?
Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked?

Greeting

I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages
bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months.  I am currently
using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and I have tried M-bonding the gages
to the bone.  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't
seem to be much else in the literature.  I have only an engineering 
background not medical or biological.  I would be interest in any
ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone.

Thanks for oyur help in Advance.

About two years ago I posted the following:
 
I am planning to write a new book called "Great Canadian Scientists."
Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca
 
The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have
to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have
had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great
Canadian scientists.
 
About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
end of this posting.
 
I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a
gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be
pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are
not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.
 
Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so
that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then
give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why
you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.
 
After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones
and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy
Kidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique.
The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with 
one paragraph biographies.
 
If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear
them.

The list is growing nicely. It's amazing to see just how much was discovered
by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but
became Americans after graduate school.
 
Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I
feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now
I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.
 
If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop
me a line.
==================================================
 
That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science
Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the
book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book
for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about
40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic
boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of
the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few
moments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12",
So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There 
will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph
biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing
will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added
richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may
also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in
Canada as well.
 
I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close 
to being it. Hope to find one soon. 
 
I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the
pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of 
the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.
 
I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian
Scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is
"scientist".

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is 
relevant for med students too.

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, 
histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass 
memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most 
med students are.

Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I 
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have
never applied them to large amounts of "data".

Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or
cheap software?   

Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an
older student who returned to school this year, organization (another
one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.

Please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material
conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong 
points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
rote memorization.  

Thanks for your help.

        You're right.  Keep an open mind to the following:

Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're
used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,
relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as
those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.

Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)
are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine
(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work
well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual
hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.

And presumably this is a matter of degree; it must be common to prescribe
a drug that has _some_ chance of giving _some_ benefit, but not a high
probability of it, and/or not a large benefit.  Right?

See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information.

I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.

It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should
avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before
preparing or eating meals.  The latter is sound advice at any time of
course.

Apart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to
get rid of your cats.

There can be. But depression is not diagnositic of thyroid deficiency.
Thyroid blood tests are easy, cheap, and effective in diagnosing thyroid

Insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of
diphenhydramine.  

For most people, this does not occur.  On the other hand, most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.
(Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
another to avoid this.)

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.

Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.

> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
> term effects?

Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 
> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
> normal, and what does one do about it?

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.

> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however.

And where do you advise people to turn for cancer information?

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these
interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-
tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

This is not an unusual practice if the doctor is also a
